### Project Overview & Key Highlights
This project focuses on visualizing and analyzing watch time data across different movie and TV show attributes. The key visualizations include:
•	Bar Chart to compare watch time across genres or highlight top-ranked titles.
•	Line Chart to illustrate trends in watch time over different premiere years.
•	Pie Chart to show the proportion of total watch time contributed by each genre.
•	Scatter Plot to explore the correlation between premiere year and watch time.
•	Heatmap to reveal the distribution of watch time by both genre and year.
These visualizations aim to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights from the watch time data to support better understanding and decision-making.
